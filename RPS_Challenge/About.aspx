    <h2>About Víctor Víquez Benavides
    </h2>
    <p>
        I&#39;m a Systems Engineer, graduated from Universidad Latina of Costa Rica in 2006. </p>
    <p>
        I have experience in the development of web applications based on Microsoft tecnologies such as ASP.net and C#.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this Challenge I used the following technologies: ASP.net, Entity Framework to interact with the database, Linq to make instructions for the insert, update, delete and select statements.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reason why I used those technologies is because I&#39;ve been using ASP.net since the last 7 years and It results easy to me, I introduced Entity Framework and Linq in this application with the purpuse of explore new environments.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this solution I implemented an application that has the ability to resolve the game Rock-Paper-Scissor, not only in a unique turn, but what I implemented a multi rounds validation, assuming the source of data of the game is a file with bracketed array format.
